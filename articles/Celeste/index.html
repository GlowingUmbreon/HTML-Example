	<h1>Game Review - Tetris Effect: Connected</h1>
	<p>
		Celeste is an adventure about overcoming adversity, and what better way to simulate adversity than with a
		punishingly difficult platformer? Don’t let that scare you, though. For those who have finished (or almost
		finished) the likes of Super Meat Boy, 1001 Spikes, and N++, Celeste probably won’t feel difficult at all. And
		that’s because, crucially, Celeste is a game that feels designed to accommodate people who can’t complete those
		games. Rather than being hard for its own sake (sometimes, in the right hands, a good thing), Celeste is hard
		for a reason that dovetails with its themes and narrative. And much like the demons that haunt the game’s
		protagonist, the difficulty does relent. You will finish this game. But if you’re like me, you’ll die upwards of
		3,000 times doing so.

	<p>
		You play as Madeline, a mopey young girl hellbent on climbing the titular Celeste Mountain. It’s a tall,
		dangerous,
		seemingly haunted mountain: not the kind you’d normally want to climb. But Madeline does, because it seems to
		her
		that she can’t get anything else right in her life. She can’t make peace with herself or anyone around her, so
		why
		not dive headfirst into a superfluous and insurmountable challenge? Why not indeed.
	</p>

	<p>
		It’s a twitch platformer: one must move with the utmost precision, usually very quickly, from the beginning of
		the
		screen to the end of it. Spikes, red ooze, fatal falls… all the usual environmental hazards are here, and
		they’ll
		all kill you on impact. Madeline can jump, dash (both mid-air and on the ground), and she can also climb walls
		and
		cliff faces. For the bulk of the game that’s all she can do, though certain environmental features, specific to
		each
		of the worlds, tinker with this format in a variety of ways. You’ll find jump pads, red glowing balls that
		hurtle
		you endlessly in any given direction, and green diamonds which, if touched mid-air, grant Madeline an extra
		mid-air
		dash. And this is just to name a few: Celeste never stops adding modifiers to its simple two-button platforming
		schematic, and most of them are centred around momentum.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some are better than others. Chaining jump dashes between green diamonds is a treat, as is manipulating
		directional
		blocks to leap deftly through levels. At times, Celeste has a ground-is-lava feel best captured recently in Ori
		and
		the Blind Forest, in the way it has you charging through the cosmos in a graceful, balletic dance.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have to be pedantic though, and mention a certain “twist” that doesn’t work: wind. When it’s blowing in
		Madeline’s
		favour, it’s plenty of fun to course through the air and between hurdles at three times the normal speed. But
		the
		moments when she must press against it feel like navigating through treacle. In an otherwise brilliant and
		challenging platformer, these are among the most tedious moments I’ve experienced in a modern 2D game. Celeste
		is
		about snappy, die-and-immediately-try-again gameplay, and this goddamned wind is a huge momentum killer. I had
		to
		take a break from the game, not because a challenge was especially hard, but because the wind tied knots in my
		chest. It was just so annoying, in the way it undermined the thrill of learning the best course through a
		problem.
		Sure, you’re at high altitude, and sure, there would be wind. But the wind sucks, and videogames aren’t real.
		Thankfully, the especially grating examples of this are few and far between.
	</p>
	<h2>
		C'est la vie
	</h2>
	<p>
		What makes Celeste really interesting is the way it weaves its narrative around this twitch platforming
		template.
		Conventional wisdom states that if a platformer is to have a narrative worth following, it must usually be an
		exploratory Metroidvania affair, or else it must be easy, lest you not feel the gratification of closure. But
		this
		story of a young girl’s efforts to make peace with herself is full of story beats and, crucially, narrative
		justification for the feel of its gameplay. One can assume that scaling a scary and mysterious mountain is
		tough,
		but the reason Madeline is scaling it, and the things we learn about her as she does, lends a sense of urgency
		and
		purpose to this toughness.
	</p>
	<p>
		The familiar pattern of failing and trying again, over and over, sometimes seemingly to no avail, is very much a
		part of Madeline’s frame of mind: whether she’s scaling a mountain or not. In this way, Celeste feels less like
		a
		niche game for fans of difficulty, and more like one that utilises its gameplay rhythms in a way that will feel
		meaningful to everyone. It helps that the platforming is leavened with more open-ended areas focused on light
		puzzling, and these often double as tutorials for the new elements that will prevail for the next few play
		sessions.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are characters in Celeste, and while they’re cutesy (a trait you can blame for the Banjo-Kazooie-esque
		garbled
		speech) they’re all haunted by their own demons. There’s the crazed hotelier, the happy-go-lucky thrill seeker,
		the
		sour old woman, and importantly, the character known as Part of Me. This is basically the sullen, fatalistic
		version
		of Madeline, a haunted, spectral figure that naysays everything the protagonist does. “Are you the weak Part of
		Me,
		or the lazy part?” Madeline asks this spectre at one point, while on the receiving end of her naysaying. Part of
		Me
		replies: “I’m the pragmatic part.” Madeline’s determination could read as a banal retreading of the “anything is
		possible” motif so frequently ladled out by American cinema and blockbuster videogames, but the message isn’t
		quite
		as bluntly hopeful as that.	</p>
	<h2>Ascension</h2>
	<p>
		But what really sets Celeste apart, aside from what many players will regard as window-dressing (the story), is
		the
		fact that you’ll finish it. Twitch platformers are my bread and butter, I love them, they’re the games I cherish
		the
		most. But I’ve never finished Super Meat Boy, I’ll never finish N++, and 1001 Spikes can die in a fire, though I
		love it dearly. I’m happy to play a game for as long as I’m capable and not finish it, but many aren’t. This
		game is
		for those who aren’t. Those looking for an especially caustic challenge can find cassettes throughout Celeste’s
		world which “remix” the game in dramatically devious ways, but I’m fairly certain that anyone, with the right
		amount
		of determination, can complete the core game. I did so in about ten hours. If you can finish Shovel Knight, you
		can
		finish this.
	</p>
	<p>
		And that’s probably my favourite aspect of Celeste: it wields difficulty in a meaningful way, but not in a way
		that
		will solely appeal to masochists and speedrunners. It reminds me of The End is Nigh, in the way its difficulty
		is
		not just a longevity-oriented feature, but a core vehicle for helping the player understand what the game is
		about.
		It’s true that you’ll feel invested in Madeline’s story; it’s true that her mental and emotional trajectory is
		one
		you want to see come good. But overall, this is a twitch platformer that feels paced like a blockbuster action
		videogame: there are moments that allow you to breath and reflect, there are opportunities to feel strong and
		times
		you’ll feel hopeless. It knows when to give you a break, it knows when to really dig its claws in. I’d recommend
		1001 Spikes to basically no one but myself, but I’d recommend Celeste to anyone.
