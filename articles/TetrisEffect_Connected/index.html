	<p>
		Over the last couple decades there have been pleanty of Tetris games and countless more if you include all
		clones or ones that somehow borrow the core idea of dropping shapes and having the player match them together.
		The gameplay needs no explanation, but this brings it officialy to the modern systems and adds a couple new
		<i>spins</i> on it as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		The game is divided up into three main subsections: journey mode, effect modes and multiplayer mode
	</p>
	<p>
		Journey mode is basically the campaign, where themed levels are organized into groups of 3-5 and they are to be
		cleared in sucession for a high score, or just individually cleared without topping out in order to proceed to
		the next subset of levels. There is audiovisual narrative tied to each level that unfolds in steps when you pass
		certain thresholds of cleared rows.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other solo section, the effect modes, includes the classics like marathon i.e. getting 150 row clears while
		the speed keeps increasing. Besides that there's ~15 other modes with some customization, such as a quick play
		mode where you can decide the speed and how many rows clears are needed, or a purify mode where you have to
		clear specific blocks from a initally half-filled board. The modes are grouped into a couple different
		categories and there's a weekly community event for playing modes of specific categories in order to make
		progess towards a shared points goal.
	</p>
	<p>
		The original soundtrack of the game by Hydelic deserves a special mention as I think it is one of the key
		components of what makes it and especially the journey mode, it makes it such a uplifting experience
